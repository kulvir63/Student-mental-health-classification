# Student-mental-health-classification
I am very excited to tell that I completed my first project on solving a machine learning problem.
The problem that I have solved is very vital nowadays in students. 
Nowadays, students are having panic attacks due to academic pressure. Not only that they are facing many mental issues. So, for that I have made a model that predict that if the student will have panic attacks or not using their academic performance.
The dataset I used was from kaggle which was gathered through a Google Forms survey given to university students to assess their mental and intellectual well-being at the moment.
I have done some EDA on the data and have build different ML models.
I discovered that random forest is the best performing model in this problem
